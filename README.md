The code uses the data from the excel table which was attached to the assignment as well. Download both files and run the python file for it to work.  

 

Troubleshooting: 

For the code to work the code must run from the same folder as the excel file, which should happen anyway when they are both downloaded. Check that both files were downloaded into the same folder. 

If issue still persists, make sure the excel file is not open as this will cause errors too. 

Else contact me if still doesnâ€™t work.
